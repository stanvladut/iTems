This is, definitely, greatest and the most complex project I’ve been working on before I get myself employed. It started as a project for the faculty’s courses, but became something that makes me work very hard at.

So, I’ve made an eCommerce website based on ReactJS. The test server was made in Java and the database was made in mySQL, both by my 2 colleagues. It took me about 3 weeks for the client application to be done.

Basically, the entire structure of the website is made in ReactJS. I’ve created about 12 components and some routes to get this done. It’s a SPA (single page application). I chose ReactJS for it's performance, but mostly because it is new and I wanted so much to learn more about it. The application was developed initially with node.js and then transferred to a Java server.

As a styling fact, the website is fully responsive for 4 resolutions  stages ( <568px , >=568px && <768px, >=768px &&<1024px, >=1024px) .It took me a lot to choose how I want to design the menus in mobile versions, but I hope I’ve made a good decision. I tried to translate all the action of changing icons and triggering actions from javascript in css to speed up the app.

To run the entire project you need to install node.js and then to clone the repository and to run „npm install” (https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) and the path must be the repository recently cloned path.

After that, you must install „cookie” module with: npm install react-cookie (https://github.com/eXon/react-cookie) in the sane directory.

The final step is to run „gulp” in command prompt and to observe the „build” folder which is compiled in the repository folder (this folder is included in gitignore, so it doesn't appear on git) . There you will find the compiled files which are used with the backend. Gulp command runs browserify, so you can check the website in browser on mobile or computer at : localhost:3000 when you still have the command prompt running gulp.

You can check demo images and sql schema for the database.
